# Educator Guide: Chapter 1 - Introduction to Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics

## Chapter Overview
This chapter introduces students to the fundamental concepts of Physical AI and humanoid robotics. It covers the foundations of embodied intelligence, robot architecture, and simulation environments.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this chapter, students should be able to:
- Define Physical AI and distinguish it from traditional AI approaches
- Understand the basic architecture of humanoid robots
- Navigate and use simulation environments for robot development

## Prerequisites
Students should have:
- Basic programming knowledge (Python preferred)
- Understanding of fundamental AI concepts
- Familiarity with basic robotics principles

## Teaching Suggestions

### Lesson 1.1: Foundations of Physical AI
