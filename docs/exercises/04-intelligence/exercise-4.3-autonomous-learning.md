# Exercise 4.3: Autonomous Learning and Adaptation

## Objective
Implement systems that enable humanoid robots to learn and adapt autonomously in changing environments.

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of machine learning and adaptation concepts
- Python programming with ML libraries
- Knowledge of online learning techniques

## Exercise Description
In this exercise, you will create systems that allow humanoid robots to continuously learn and adapt their behavior based on experience and environmental changes.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Online Learning Implementation
1. Implement an online learning algorithm for continuous adaptation
2. Test the system's ability to adapt to changing conditions
3. Evaluate the balance between learning and stability

### Task 2: Lifelong Learning System
1. Design a system that can learn new tasks without forgetting previous ones
2. Implement mechanisms to prevent catastrophic forgetting
3. Test the system with sequential learning tasks

### Task 3: Self-Improvement Mechanisms
1. Implement self-monitoring and self-evaluation capabilities
2. Create mechanisms for the robot to identify areas for improvement
3. Test autonomous improvement in a controlled environment
