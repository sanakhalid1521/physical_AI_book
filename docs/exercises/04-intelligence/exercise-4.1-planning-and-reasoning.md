# Exercise 4.1: Planning and Reasoning

## Objective
Implement automated planning and logical reasoning systems for humanoid robot decision-making.

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of planning algorithms (STRIPS, PDDL, etc.)
- Logic and reasoning concepts
- Python programming skills

## Exercise Description
In this exercise, you will implement planning and reasoning systems that enable humanoid robots to make complex decisions and execute multi-step tasks.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Classical Planning Implementation
1. Implement a classical planning algorithm (e.g., forward search, GraphPlan)
2. Define a domain and problem in PDDL or similar formalism
3. Test the planner on humanoid-specific tasks

### Task 2: Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) Planning
1. Implement an HTN planner for complex humanoid tasks
2. Define methods and tasks for high-level goals
3. Compare HTN planning with classical approaches

### Task 3: Logical Reasoning Integration
1. Implement logical reasoning capabilities (first-order logic, knowledge bases)
2. Integrate reasoning with planning for more sophisticated decision-making
3. Test the system with incomplete or uncertain information

## Deliverables
- Code implementing planning and reasoning algorithms
- Domain definitions and problem instances
- Performance comparison between different planning approaches
- Analysis of reasoning effectiveness

## Evaluation Criteria
- Successful implementation of planning algorithms
- Effective handling of humanoid-specific constraints
- Proper integration of planning and reasoning
- Robustness to incomplete or uncertain information

## Resources
- Chapter 4 readings on planning and reasoning
- Planning algorithm documentation
- PDDL or similar domain definition tools
