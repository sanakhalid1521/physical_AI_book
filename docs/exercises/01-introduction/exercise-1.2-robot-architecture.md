# Exercise 1.2: Humanoid Robot Architecture Overview

## Objective
Analyze the key components and subsystems of humanoid robot architecture and understand their interconnections.

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of robotics components
- Knowledge of system architecture concepts

## Exercise Description
In this exercise, you will examine the architecture of humanoid robots, focusing on how different subsystems work together to enable complex behaviors and interactions.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Component Identification
1. Identify and describe the 5 main subsystems of a humanoid robot
2. Explain the function of each subsystem
3. Create a diagram showing how these subsystems interconnect

### Task 2: Sensor Integration Analysis
1. List the primary sensors used in humanoid robots
2. Describe how sensor data is processed and integrated
3. Analyze the challenges of real-time sensor fusion

### Task 3: Actuator and Control Systems
1. Research different types of actuators used in humanoid robots
2. Compare the advantages and disadvantages of each actuator type
3. Explain how control systems coordinate multiple actuators

## Deliverables
- Detailed diagram of humanoid robot architecture
- Written analysis of subsystem interactions
- Comparison table of different actuator types
- Reflection on integration challenges
