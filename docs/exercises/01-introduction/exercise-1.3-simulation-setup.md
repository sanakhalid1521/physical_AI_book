# Exercise 1.3: Simulation Environment Setup

## Objective
Set up and configure a simulation environment for humanoid robot development and testing.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+ installed
- Basic knowledge of simulation software (PyBullet, Gazebo, or similar)
- Understanding of 3D coordinate systems

## Exercise Description
In this exercise, you will install, configure, and test a simulation environment suitable for humanoid robot development. You will create basic simulation scenarios to test robot behaviors.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Environment Installation
1. Install PyBullet or your chosen simulation environment
2. Verify the installation by running a basic example
3. Install any necessary dependencies for humanoid robot simulation

### Task 2: Basic Robot Model
1. Load or create a basic humanoid robot model in the simulation
2. Configure the robot's physical properties (mass, friction, etc.)
3. Test basic movement capabilities of the robot

### Task 3: Environment Interaction
1. Create a simple environment with obstacles or objects
2. Implement basic collision detection
3. Test the robot's interaction with the environment
