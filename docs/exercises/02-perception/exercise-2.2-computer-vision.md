2. Test the algorithm on robot-specific objects (e.g., cups, balls, furniture)
3. Evaluate detection accuracy and processing speed

### Task 2: Visual Tracking
1. Implement a visual tracking algorithm for moving objects
2. Test tracking performance with different object types and speeds
3. Handle tracking failures and reacquisition scenarios

### Task 3: Scene Understanding
