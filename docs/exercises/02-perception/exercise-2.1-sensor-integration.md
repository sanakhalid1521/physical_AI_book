# Exercise 2.1: Sensor Integration and Data Processing

## Objective
Implement and evaluate sensor integration techniques for humanoid robot perception systems.

## Prerequisites
- Python programming skills
- Understanding of basic sensor types (IMU, cameras, LIDAR, etc.)
- Knowledge of data processing concepts

## Exercise Description
In this exercise, you will work with different sensor types commonly used in humanoid robots, implement data fusion techniques, and evaluate the effectiveness of integrated sensor data.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Sensor Data Acquisition
1. Set up simulation or physical access to multiple sensor types
2. Collect synchronized data from at least 3 different sensor types
3. Visualize the raw sensor data to understand its characteristics

### Task 2: Data Synchronization and Calibration
1. Implement time synchronization for sensor data streams
2. Apply calibration procedures to correct sensor biases
3. Validate the calibration by comparing measurements

### Task 3: Sensor Fusion Implementation
1. Implement a basic sensor fusion algorithm (e.g., Kalman filter or particle filter)
2. Compare fused sensor data with individual sensor readings
3. Evaluate the improvement in accuracy and reliability

## Deliverables
- Code implementing sensor data acquisition and fusion
- Visualization of raw and fused sensor data
