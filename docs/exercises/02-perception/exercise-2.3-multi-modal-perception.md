# Exercise 2.3: Multi-modal Perception

## Objective
Develop and test multi-modal perception systems that integrate visual, auditory, and tactile sensing for humanoid robots.

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of multiple sensor types
- Experience with data fusion techniques
- Programming skills in Python

## Exercise Description
In this exercise, you will create a multi-modal perception system that combines information from different sensory modalities to improve robot awareness and decision-making capabilities.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Multi-modal Data Collection
1. Collect synchronized data from visual, auditory, and tactile sensors
2. Create a dataset that includes multiple sensory inputs
3. Annotate the data with relevant environmental information

### Task 2: Cross-modal Integration
1. Implement algorithms that can process and integrate multiple sensory inputs
2. Design a system that can handle missing or unreliable sensory data
3. Test the system's ability to make better decisions with multi-modal input

### Task 3: Perceptual Reasoning
1. Implement reasoning algorithms that use multi-modal information
2. Create scenarios that demonstrate the benefits of multi-modal perception
3. Evaluate the improvement in perception accuracy compared to single-modal systems

## Deliverables
- Code for multi-modal perception system
- Dataset with multi-modal sensory information
- Performance comparison between single and multi-modal systems
- Analysis of integration challenges and solutions

## Evaluation Criteria
- Successful integration of multiple sensory modalities
- Demonstrable improvement in perception with multi-modal input
- Robust handling of sensor failures or missing data
- Effective reasoning based on multi-modal information
