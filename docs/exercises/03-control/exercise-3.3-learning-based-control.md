## Exercise Description
In this exercise, you will implement learning-based control algorithms that allow humanoid robots to adapt their behavior based on experience and demonstrations.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Reinforcement Learning Implementation
1. Implement a basic Q-learning algorithm for a simple humanoid control task
2. Design appropriate reward functions for the task
3. Train the agent and evaluate learning progress

### Task 2: Imitation Learning
1. Implement an imitation learning algorithm (behavioral cloning or GAIL)
2. Collect demonstration data for a humanoid task
3. Train the system to imitate the demonstrated behavior

### Task 3: Adaptive Control
