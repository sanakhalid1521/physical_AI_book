# Exercise 3.2: Behavioral Control Systems

## Objective
Design and implement behavioral control systems for humanoid robots using finite state machines and behavior trees.

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of control systems concepts
- Programming experience with state machines or behavior trees
- Knowledge of humanoid robot capabilities

## Exercise Description
In this exercise, you will implement different behavioral control architectures for humanoid robots and compare their effectiveness for various tasks.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Finite State Machine Implementation
1. Design a finite state machine for a simple humanoid task (e.g., walking to a location)
2. Implement the state machine with proper state transitions
3. Test the FSM in simulation with different scenarios

### Task 2: Behavior Tree Implementation
1. Design a behavior tree for the same task as in Task 1
2. Implement the behavior tree with proper node types and logic
3. Compare the behavior tree approach with the FSM approach

### Task 3: Complex Task Integration
1. Design a control system for a more complex task using either FSM or behavior trees
2. Integrate sensory feedback into the control system
3. Handle exceptions and error recovery in the control system

## Deliverables
- Code implementing FSM and behavior tree control systems
- Comparison analysis of both approaches
- Simulation results demonstrating control system effectiveness
- Documentation of exception handling strategies

## Evaluation Criteria
- Correct implementation of behavioral control systems
- Effective handling of complex tasks and exceptions
- Clear comparison between different control approaches
- Robustness to environmental changes and sensor noise

## Resources
- Chapter 3 readings on behavioral control
- FSM and behavior tree documentation
- Simulation environment with humanoid robot models
