# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook Constitution

## Vision
To create an accessible, hands-on learning resource that empowers beginners to intermediate learners to understand, build, and experiment with physical AI and humanoid robotics systems through practical, project-based education.

## Core Principles

### I. Hands-On Learning First
Learning through doing is the foundation of this textbook. Every concept must be accompanied by practical exercises, code examples, and real-world applications. Theory is introduced only to support practical implementation, not as an end in itself. Each chapter must include at least one hands-on project or experiment that readers can complete with accessible hardware/software.

### II. Beginner-to-Intermediate Accessibility
Content must be structured to accommodate learners from zero to intermediate knowledge levels. Complex topics are broken into digestible, progressive steps with clear prerequisites stated. All technical jargon is defined when first introduced, and concepts build systematically without assuming prior knowledge beyond stated prerequisites.

### III. Docusaurus Documentation Excellence
All content must follow Docusaurus best practices for documentation: clear navigation, search functionality, versioning, and responsive design. Content is structured with consistent formatting, proper headings hierarchy, cross-references, and integrated code examples. Documentation must be maintainable, extensible, and accessible.

### IV. Practical AI & Robotics Integration
Focus on the intersection of AI and physical systems, emphasizing how AI algorithms control and interact with real hardware. Content must bridge the gap between theoretical AI concepts and their physical implementations in humanoid robots, covering perception, decision-making, and actuation in real-world contexts.

### V. Reproducible Learning Experiences
All examples, code, and projects must be fully reproducible with documented setup instructions, dependencies, and expected outcomes. Each hands-on section includes step-by-step guidance, troubleshooting tips, and verification methods to ensure learners can successfully complete exercises.

### VI. Safety and Ethics by Design
Physical AI and robotics education must include safety considerations and ethical implications from the beginning. Content addresses safety protocols, risk assessment, and ethical considerations in AI and robotics development. Learners are taught responsible development practices and awareness of societal impacts.

## Technical Constraints

### Technology Stack Requirements
- Platform: Docusaurus v3+ for documentation and content delivery
- Languages: Python primarily, with C++/ROS for robotics-specific sections
- Hardware: Focus on accessible platforms (e.g., Raspberry Pi, Arduino,低成本 humanoid platforms like Poppy, NAO)
- Simulation: Gazebo, Webots, or similar accessible simulation environments
- Version Control: Git with clear documentation of code examples and exercises

### Content Standards
- All code examples must be tested and verified to work with specified dependencies
- Hardware requirements must be achievable with under $500 budget for core projects
- Content must be accessible to learners with basic programming knowledge
- All mathematical concepts explained with visual aids and practical examples

## Development Workflow

### Content Creation Process
- Each chapter follows the hands-on learning principle with practical exercises
- Code examples are tested in isolated environments before inclusion
- Peer review required for all technical content accuracy
- Beta testing with target audience before final publication

### Quality Gates
- All practical exercises must be verified by independent testers
- Code examples must include error handling and debugging guidance
- Content must pass accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA minimum)
- Technical accuracy verified by domain experts

## Governance

This constitution serves as the foundational guide for all content creation and project decisions. All additions, modifications, and extensions to the textbook must align with these principles. Content creators must verify compliance with accessibility, safety, and educational effectiveness standards. Updates to this constitution require documented justification and approval from project maintainers.
